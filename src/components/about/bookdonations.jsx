        The Village Library accepts donations of current hardback and paperback
        books, and children’s books. Virtually all items that you donate to the
        library will be sold, generating much-needed revenue for your library.
        Therefore, all donated items must be in very good condition, not damaged
        or outdated. Unfortunately, there are items we cannot accept such as
        magazines, reference and textbooks, travel guides and cassette tapes.
        Please see the list below for more specific information regarding all
        donated items.
