      <p>
        In 1990 a small but visionary group of people on Skidaway Island
        conceived the idea of a community library. It started out small with
        books donated by residents in a store front located in the commercial
        section of the island. Through the generosity of many people a building
        was constructed in 1996. Today we have more than 24,000 books. In the
        last two years, we have served over 2,400 members.

        Unlike tax supported public libraries, we receive no funds from Federal,
        State or local governments. Our funding comes from membership fees,
        donations, book rentals, the sale of used books and engraved bricks.
        Because we are a Section 501 (c) (3) organization, all donations are
        tax-deductible.
