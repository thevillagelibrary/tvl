        <b>Priorities And Outcomes</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The year began with a Board Retreat in June, which resulted in
        priorities and action plans for the upcoming year. The priority areas
        were:
      </p>
      <section className="reportbullets">
        <p>Volunteer Excellence</p>
        <p>Governance</p>
        <p>Fundraising</p>
        <p>Collection Development</p>
        <p>Membership.</p>
      </section>
      <p>
        The primary accomplishments that resulted from the meeting’s planning
        for the year were:
      </p>
      <section className="reportbullets">
        <p>Bylaws revisions</p>
        <p>Updates and clarifications of the election process</p>
        <p>Creation of an annual calendar</p>
        <p>Creation of a roster format to help track Board terms</p>
        <p>Action to refresh and re-think the art in the Library</p>
        <p>Expanding and continuing the Brick Program.</p>
      </section>
      <p>
        <b>Facing Budget Shortfalls</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The major challenge of the year was balancing the budget. During
        preparation of the 2024 fiscal year budget, the Executive Committee
        faced a decrease in income, particularly the donations., and an increase
        in many of the expenditures. After lengthy discussion and careful
        consideration, the Board took the following steps:
      </p>
      <section className="reportbullets">
        <p>Increased the membership dues from $10 to $20 a year</p>
        <p>Increased the sale price on books across the Board</p>
        <p>Increased the bag of books fee from $10 to $15.</p>
      </section>
      <p>
        <b>Landings Landlovers' Grants</b>
      </p>
      <p>In 2023, the Library received funds to:</p>
      <section className="reportbullets">
        <p>
          Buy a new laser printer that enable us to print flyers and forms more
          easily
        </p>
        <p>Add tools to enhance children’s story time</p>
        <p>
          Strengthen the children’s collection by supplementing the book budget.
        </p>
      </section>
      <p>
        The application for the 2024 grant was due March 20, and resulted in
        awarding of funds for the following activities, which must be completed
        by November 2024, with a report due no later than January 31, 2025:
      </p>
      <section className="reportbullets">
        <p>
          Purchasing two new computers to replace those at the Circulation Desk,
          cascading those computers to replace the two in the workroom, which
          will then replace the catalog stations allowing those computers to be
          recycled
        </p>
        <p>
          Working with the Skidaway Audubon and TLA joint program, Water Wise,
          to evaluate the current irrigation system and upgrade it with new
          tools that are projected to save the library up to 40% a year on
          water.
        </p>
      </section>
      <p>
        <b>Book Sales</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The Fall and Spring Book & Art Festivals were successful as
        Vice-President for Community Relations Brenda Day continues to build the
        event with expanded participation of community organizations, artists,
        craftspeople, authors, and other. With the departure of Lynn Townsend
        after the Fall sale, Mary McBride assumed responsibility for
        coordinating the book sale in Spring 2024. She brought her wonderful
        organizational skills to the event, which resulted in income of $1,000
        more than any previous year.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, in the area of book sales, the Library has expanded its efforts to
        identify donated books that have value above the usual sale price. One
        donated book, The Soul of a Tree, was a signed first edition worth over
        $500. The book is currently consigned to The Book Lady Bookstore and is
        listed at $1,200. The volunteers who manage the sale books are using an
        online tool to identify valuable books, and Vice President for
        Operations Nancy Petronchak is currently evaluating eBay as a means for
        selling other books with higher value.

        <b>Appreciation</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        As my six years on the Board, including four years as President, come to
        an end, I want to express my deep appreciation to the people who have
        served on the Board—and the amazing team of volunteers who keep the
        Village Library operating and serving the public all year round.
      </p>
      <p>Thank you!</p>
      <p>Sandy Cooper, President</p>
