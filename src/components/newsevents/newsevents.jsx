        <b>Priorities and Outcomes</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The Board held a planning retreat in June which resulted in priorities and
        action plans for the upcoming year. The priorities agreed to were:
      </p>
      <section className="reportbullets">
        <p>Organization</p>
        <p>Modernization</p>
        <p>Collection Development</p>
        <p>Library Events</p>
      </section>
      <p>
        The primary accomplishments that resulted from the meeting&apos;s planning
        for the year were:
      </p>
      <section className="reportbullets">
        <p>The storage room, office, front desk, public areas, and file cabinet were decluttered and reorganized</p>
        <p>New shelving was purchased and installed in the book sales area</p>
        <p>Zelle was adopted as an alternate payment method for membership, large overdue payments, and book sales</p>
        <p>DVDs were removed from the library&apos;s collection and sales shelves</p>
        <p>A successful author interview and book signing event took place on March 31</p>
        <p>A volunteer appreciation picnic (the first post-pandemic) took place on May 4.</p>
      </section>
      <p>
        <b>Book Sales and Donations</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to the generosity of our members, donations almost doubled in 2024 from
        the previous year, which was greatly appreciated as the library&apos;s
        operating expenses have increased.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the Litten Fund for the purchase of books ends this year, this is the
        first year of the newly established and greatly appreciated Sandberg Fund,
        also designated for book purchases. Another generous donation from the
        Landings Mah Jong community in 2024 was designated for book purchases as
        well. Other individual donations also made it possible for the library to
        increase the budget for book purchases.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Fall and Spring Book & Art Festivals again were successful events
        enjoyed by the community. The proceeds from the Spring Book Sale were a
        record for the library.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Landlovers&apos; Association Grants</b>
      </p>
      <p>In 2024, the library received funds to:</p>
      <section className="reportbullets">
        <p>Purchase two new computers for the Front Desk</p>
        <p>Install a new sprinkler system in front of the library</p>
      </section>
      <p>
        For 2025, a grant was awarded to assist the library in hosting additional
        author events for our patrons and the community by providing:
      </p>
      <section className="reportbullets">
        <p>Seating for events and our reading room</p>
        <p>Signage to promote the events</p>
        <p>Amplification for author interviews</p>
        <p>Smart thermostats to maintain comfortable temperatures</p>
      </section>
      <p>
        <b>Appreciation</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The combined efforts of the entire Board and a host of volunteers
        contributed to a successful year at the library.
