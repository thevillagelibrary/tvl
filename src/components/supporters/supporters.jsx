        We wish to thank all the organizations, businesses, and dedicated
        volunteers who have made our library possible.

        A special thanks goes to David L. Litten, who was a major donor to the
        new wing in memory of his late wife, Ann Resch Litten, and who continues
        to suport the library generously in her memory.
      </p>
      <p>
        A special thanks also goes to Landings Landlovers, which has been a
        regular and generous supporter of the library for many years.
